# Changelog

All notable changes to the Unseenet software are listed here. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
versions follow [semantic versioning](docs/development.md#versioning).
Protocol changes are made through the [UN-RFC series](rfc/), not here.

## [Unreleased]

### Protocol
- Draft UN-RFC 0009 (inbox groups and local groups), 0011 (node
  information and operator contact) and 0012 (retention, archive nodes
  and history).

### Added
- Inbox groups: private messages sealed to the recipient and signed with a
  one-time key, with a verified sender inside. Every identity gets a
  personal inbox (`inbox@<fingerprint>`).
- Local groups that are never replicated between nodes.
- `LIST UNSEENET.NODEINFO` and an `[operator]` section in `node.toml`.
- TUI: `m` private message, `o` node information and "write to operator",
  private replies, inbox at the top of the group list.
- CLI: `group-create --type inbox --local`.
- TUI: groups shown as a tree by hierarchy (`dk.*`, `comp.*`, ...), both in
  the main view and when browsing the node's groups.
- TUI: every action is in the command palette (Ctrl+P), plus "Private
  messages" and "Mark group as read".

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-15

First public release. Pre-alpha: expect breaking changes.

### Protocol
- Draft UN-RFC 0000-0007: process, architecture, article format,
  identities and cryptography, groups and closed groups, ONNTP transport
  and peering, proof-of-work postage, data at rest. Protocol version `1`.

### Node
- ONNTP server over a Tor onion service, with its own private Tor process.
- Validation of signatures, content-derived Message-IDs, postage and group
  rules; cancels; retention.
- Push replication to peers (MODE STREAM / CHECK / TAKETHIS) with optional
  peer authentication and random forwarding delay.
- Group carrying policies: `accept`, `trusted`, `manual`.
- `deploy/install-node.sh` and a systemd unit.

### Client
- `unseenet-tui`: groups, threaded posts, compose and reply, browse and
  subscribe, create groups of all four types, invitations to closed groups.
- Encrypted vault (Argon2id + XSalsa20-Poly1305) and an encrypted offline
  cache, so saved posts can be read without a connection.
- `unseenet`: command line client.
